# Hex Grid
## Cube Coordinate System
* [Cube Coordinate System](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/)

## Approach
* The solution uses the abovementioned "Cube" coordinate system.
* The "Cube" coordinates allow easy calculation of the next neighbor in one of the six directions.
* The "Cube" manhattan distance to the origin can easily be calculated, as well.
